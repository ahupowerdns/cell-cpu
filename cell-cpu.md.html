                            **Your new prokaryotic CPU**


Introduction
===============================================================================

A warm welcome to your new CPU! The Prokaryotic Cell is not quite like any
CPU you will have worked with before, but many of the same principles apply.
A micrometer long, weighing in at a picogram and consuming around a picowatt
per megabyte of firmware, it is an impressive piece of technology.

The Cell is a quaternary (base 4) system, so instead of bits with a value of    *********************
0 and 1, we go all the way to 3. And unlike most other CPUs, in which 8 bits    * +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ *
make up a byte, in the Cell, 3 quaternary bits (or bases) make up a codon,      * |0|1|1|0|0|1|1|0| *
which thus contains six bits.                                                   * +-+-+-+-+-+---+-+ *
                                                                                *                   *                                                             
                                                                                *   A typical byte  *
                                                                                *                   *
                                                                                *********************





*********************In most computing architectures, bits are stored as voltages, electrical          
*   +-+-+-+ +-+-+-+ *charges or shifts in magnetic orientations. In the Cell, each quaternary bit      
*   |A|C|G| |G|G|T| *(base, from hereon) consists of 13 to 15 atoms.                                   
*   +-+-+-+ +-+-+-+ *                                                                                  
*                   *                                                                                   
* Two typical codons*                                                                                  
*********************                                                                                  


In a traditional CPU, bits get stored like this:


  Number| Symbol | Storage 
 -------|------|----------
    0   |  0   |   Low voltage, no charge, no phase transition
    1   |  1   |   High voltage, charge, phase transition
    [Traditional CPUs] 

Whereas in DNA, the following table applies:

  Number| Symbol | Storage 
 -------|------|----------
    0   |  A   |   Adenosine
    1   |  C   |   Cytosine
    2   |  G   |   Guanine
    3   |  T/U |   Thymine/Uracil
    [DNA/RNA storage] 


Firmware
--------
The firmware of a typical simple cell consists of a few million bases. As
each base encodes 2 bits, a fully functioning cell can therefore operate
based on less than one megabyte of code.

Unlike regular CPUs, in which the transistors are fixed and the microcode is
not visible from the regular instruction set, the cell takes a more ‘Lisp’
like approach where the code is the data is the CPU.

In other words, the very architecture of the cell CPU is code, which can
even be changed at runtime. 

Hierarchies of storage
======================
Long term storage
----------------------
Like common computing systems, the prokaryotic cell has multiple kinds of
storage. The basic firmware (called the genome) is stored as DNA, a single
molecule string of millions of bases. 
While DNA can be altered, it mostly isn’t. In this way, this ‘chromosome
molecule’ functions a lot like Flash memory. Reading out DNA happens at
about 60 bases/second, or 120bps. A full linear read of the genome would
take around a day, but massive parallel access is available. In addition,
bulk copies of DNA can be made at around 1000 bases/second, or 2kbps.


Metric            | Harddisk   | Flash       | RAM         | DNA
------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|-----
Capacity          | Terabytes  | Gigabytes   | Gigabytes   | 100s of Megabytes
Linear Read speed | 100s of Megabytes/s| Megabytes/s | Terabytes/s | 15 bytes/s
Parallel reads    |    1       |      32     | 1           | 1000
Parallel bandwidth| Megabytes/s| Gigabytes/s | Terabytes/s | 15 kbytes/s
Bulk copy speed   | Megabytes/s| Gigabytes/s | Terabytes/s | 250 bytes/s
[Various metrics for read speeds]

Organisation of storage, content addressable memory
---------------------------------------------------

Within the ±megabyte of DNA there is organisation and metadata. While DNA is
typically treated as linear storage when studied, and we denote interesting
features by their offset in the genome, biologically DNA acts as content
addressable memory. 

This means that specific parts of DNA are retrieved based on their content,
and not their position. This is feasible because of the tiny (physical) size
of the genome (1–2 millimeters long loop, stored in &lt;3 cubic micrometers).

Specific molecules can therefore rapidly bind to places that they are
looking for.

The genome consists of a few thousand clearly separated units called genes,
containing a few kilobits of information on average. Some of these genes
encode for the core functionality itself. The machinery to encode and read
DNA is described in DNA, for example. This leads to obvious bootstrapping
problems.

In addition, although three bases together make up a codon (the ‘byte’),
unlike traditional CPUs, the three bases are not physically tied up into a
byte while stored. In other words, sub-byte addressing is possible, and
starting at the wrong place leads to framing errors. 

Active memory
-------------
Much like code from flash memory mostly has to be read into RAM before it
can function, DNA has to be translated into RNA before it does anything. The
translation to RNA removes some of the metadata which indicated where a gene
begins and ends. As a gene is turned into a (loose) strand of RNA, it may
become active directly. RNA molecules can perform functions themselves and
interact with other pieces of DNA. 

RNA can also be transcribed into other molecules (amino acids), and this is
performed by the ribosomes.


Opcodes
==============
Much like regular CPUs encode operations as opcodes, the cell maps codons to
amino acids. Where an opcode operates on registers or locations in memory,
amino acids are molecules that interact with other molecules to perform
operations or to trigger further actions. The principle is the same however:
a digital code gets mapped into operations that make things happen.

There are 64 codons, but only 20 amino acids, so there is ample degeneracy
in the mapping.  From the organization of the codon/amino acid mapping, it
can be shown that it was highly likely that very early cells used only two
bases per codon.  The third base was a later addition.  This can be compared
to earlier 8 bit CPUs opcodes still being recognizable in current 64 bit
microprocessors.

Note that four codons are special:

 * ATG is the START codon, and encodes within the linear DNA the start of a
   new gene. Subsequent instances of ATG encode for Methionine
 * TAA/TAG/TGA are the STOP codons, which indicate that a gene ends at this
   location. Because the STOP must be unambigious, these codons do not also
   encode for an amino acid.

In the following table, the first two nucleotides of a codon are in the
first column.  The final nucleotide is found in the following columns.  Note
the odd sorting of the nucleotides (TCAG).  It turns out that our alphabetic
ordering produces a more confusing table.  Orderered as TCAG, the whole
table simplifies.

Compare this table to the opcodes of the venerable 6502 CPU which looks
highly similar, including degeneracy. Here the first column describes the
high nibble and the first bit of the low nibble. The remaining columns are
the 3 final bits of the low nibble.
